Optimized grid is a procedural grid and it is a great alternative to Unity's grid made of gameObjects. Most beginners don't understand how memory works in Unity and they will make bad decisions by following bad tutorials with bad programming practices. With this tool you will not need to manage memory and object pooling. Grid's nodes will not exist in memory while inactive.
